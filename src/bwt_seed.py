"""Shared BWT k-mer seeding core for tandem repeat detection.

Used by both Tier 2 and Tier 3.  The algorithm is:
  1. Sample k-mers from the text at a configurable stride.
  2. Use FM-index backward_search / locate_positions to find all occurrences.
  3. Detect periodic runs in the position arrays (arithmetic progressions).
  4. Extend seed positions with mismatch tolerance.
  5. Return raw candidate regions for tier-specific post-processing.

    """BWT k-mer seeding scan for tandem repeat candidates.

    Samples k-mers from the text at `stride` intervals, uses FM-index to
    find all occurrences, detects periodic runs in the occurrence positions,
    and extends seed hits with mismatch tolerance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bwt : BWTCore
        The BWT/FM-index built on the sequence.
    min_period, max_period : int
        Period range to search for.
    kmer_size : int
        Length of k-mers to sample (default 16).  Should be shorter than
        min_period so that each repeat copy contains at least one full k-mer.
    stride : int
        Distance between consecutive k-mer samples (default 50).
    min_copies : int
        Minimum number of tandem copies required.
    allowed_mismatch_rate : float
        Mismatch tolerance for extension (0.0-0.5).
    tolerance_ratio : float
        Tolerance for period jitter in periodic run detection (default 3%).
    max_occurrences : int
        Skip k-mers with more occurrences than this (likely low-complexity).
    covered_mask : np.ndarray or None
        Boolean mask of positions already found by a previous tier.
        Positions where covered_mask[i] is True are skipped as seed origins.
    show_progress : bool
        Whether to print progress.
    label : str
        Label prefix for progress messages.

    Returns
    -------
    list[SeedCandidate]
        Raw repeat candidates.  Callers perform tier-specific post-processing
        (primitive period reduction, HOR detection, DP refinement, etc.).
